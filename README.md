# Artificial Intelligence Projects Repository

This repository contains four simple AI-based applications:

1. Chatbot with Rule-Based System
2. Recommendation System
3. Face Detection and Recognition

Each application is designed to demonstrate basic AI concepts and provide a practical, interactive experience.

## Chatbot with Rule-Based System

### Description
A simple rule-based chatbot that interacts with users by following predefined rules and patterns.

### Features
- Predefined responses based on user input
- Pattern matching for dynamic responses
- Easy to extend with new rules

### How to Run
Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -o chatbot RuleBasedChatbot.cpp
```

Run the executable:

```bash
./chatbot
```

## Recommendation System

### Description
A basic recommendation system that suggests items to users based on their past preferences.

### Features
- User input for preferences
- Recommendation algorithm based on similarity
- Output of recommended items

### How to Run
Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -o recommendation RecommendationSystem.cpp
```

Run the executable:

```bash
./recommendation
```

## Face Detection and Recognition

### Description
An application that detects and recognizes faces in an image using Haar cascade classifier.

### Features
- Face detection using Haar cascade
- Rectangle drawing around detected faces
- User input for image path

### How to Run
Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ -o facedetection FaceDetection.cpp
```

Run the executable:

```bash
./facedetection
```
